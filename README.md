# Intel Products Sentiment Analysis Project

## Project Title: PS-11 Intel Products Sentiment Analysis from Online Reviews

### Overview
This project aims to analyze sentiments from Amazon reviews of Intel processors. The process involves scraping reviews, pre-processing the data, and employing machine learning techniques for sentiment analysis. The approach utilizes the RoBERTa algorithm to enhance semantic understanding. The workflow encompasses tokenization, data cleaning using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), feature extraction, and model training. Insights into the strengths and weaknesses of processors are derived for Intel engineers, along with performance comparisons between Transformer models. Additionally, word clouds and graphs are generated to visualize the findings, providing valuable data-driven insights.
